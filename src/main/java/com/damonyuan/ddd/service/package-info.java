/**
 * This module is about the services in DDD
 * <p>
 * The services handle
 * 1. business logic/methods
 * 2. persistent-related logic/methods
 * <p>
 * Note that a service doesn't have to map to a single domain,
 * it might include a collection of multiple domains. The return of a
 * service method might be the output of a controller.
